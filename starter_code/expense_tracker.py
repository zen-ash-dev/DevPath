Project:    Personal Expense Tracker
Difficulty: Beginner
Skills:     Python, CSV module, datetime module
Time:       Low (a few hours)

What you will build:
    A command-line tool that lets you log daily expenses, view them in a
    formatted table, see a monthly breakdown by category, and export a
    filtered report to a new CSV file.

How to run:
    python expense_tracker.py

Learning goals:
    - Reading and writing CSV files
    - Working with Python's datetime module
    - Organising code into small, focused functions
    - Building a simple interactive text menu

Roadmap:
    Step 1:  Project is already set up — run it and explore the menu
    Step 2:  Complete add_expense() with category and amount validation
    Step 3:  Complete list_expenses() to print a formatted table
    Step 4:  Complete monthly_summary() to group totals by category
    Step 5:  Complete filter_by_category() to search by category name
    Step 6:  Complete export_to_csv() to save a filtered report
    Step 7:  Test with at least 10 sample entries across different months
