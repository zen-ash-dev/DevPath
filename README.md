## Why DevPath Exists

Most beginner developers complete tutorials but struggle with the next step:
**what to build on their own.**

DevPath was created to solve that problem.

Instead of endlessly searching for project ideas, users can enter their
skills, interests, experience level, and available time to instantly get
personalized project recommendations with:

- Step-by-step roadmaps
- Curated learning resources
- Beginner-friendly starter code
- Clear progression paths

The goal is simple:

> Help developers move from “learning syntax” to “building real projects.”

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Personalized recommendations | Matches projects based on skills, level, interest, and time |
| Rule-based scoring engine | Transparent and explainable recommendation logic |
| Beginner-friendly architecture | Small, modular, and easy to understand |
| Starter code templates | Downloadable boilerplate code for projects |
| Guided roadmaps | Structured learning and implementation flow |
| Open-source contribution ready | Designed for GSSoC and beginner contributors |

## How It Works

```text
User inputs                 Scoring engine              Output
-----------                 --------------              ------
Skills (Python, HTML)  -->  +3 per skill match   -->   Top 3 projects
Level (Beginner)       -->  +2 if level matches         with:
Interest (Data)        -->  +2 if interest matches       - Roadmap
Time (Low)             -->  +1 if time matches           - Resources
                                                          - Starter code
```

The algorithm lives entirely in `utils/recommender.py`. Weights are named
constants at the top of the file — easy to tune without reading the whole module.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/komalharshita/devpath.git
cd devpath
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**http://127.0.0.1:5000** — that is the entire setup.

```bash
# Verify everything works
python tests/test_basic.py
# 27 passed, 0 failed out of 27 tests
```

## Routes

| Method | Path | Returns |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/` | Homepage with skill form |
| POST | `/api/recommend` | JSON — top 3 matched projects |
| GET | `/project/<id>` | HTML — full project detail page |
| GET | `/project/<id>/code` | JSON — starter code content |
| GET | `/project/<id>/download` | File — starter code download |

## Extending the Dataset

The dataset is a plain JSON file. Add a new project by appending to
`data/projects.json`:

```json
{
  "id": 8,
  "title": "Todo CLI App",
  "skills": ["Python"],
  "level": "Beginner",
  "interest": "Automation",
  "time": "Low",
  "description": "A command-line task manager that saves to JSON.",
  "features": ["Add/remove tasks", "Mark complete", "Filter by status"],
  "tech_stack": ["Python", "json module"],
  "roadmap": ["Step 1: Define data structure", "Step 2: Write add_task()"],
  "resources": ["Python docs: https://docs.python.org"],
  "starter_code": "starter_code/todo_cli.py"
}
```

No backend changes needed. The engine picks it up on the next request.
